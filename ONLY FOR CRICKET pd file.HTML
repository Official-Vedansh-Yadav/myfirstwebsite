<P><FONT SIZE  = "10">Chopra made his Test debut in Ahmedabad against New Zealand in late 2003 as India sought to find an opening partner for his Delhi teammate Virender Sehwag. Chopra's international career started well, scoring two half-centuries against New Zealand during 2003/04 in the second Test in Mohali. On the 2003–04 tour to Australia, he featured in many solid partnerships with Virender Sehwag, including two century opening partnerships in Melbourne and Sydney. Chopra's work in seeing off the new ball saw him credited with the large scores that India accumulated in that series when middle-order batsmen Rahul Dravid, V. V. S. Laxman, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly regularly compiled large centuries.

On the subsequent tour to Pakistan, he compiled another century stand with Virender Sehwag as India posted more than 600 runs in the first innings to set up a heavy innings defeat of arch-rivals Pakistan in the first Test in Multan. However, in the second Test, the Indian batsmen failed in a losing effort, apart from a century from Yuvraj Singh, who played in place of the injured captain Sourav Ganguly. When Ganguly returned for the final Test, Chopra was axed and Yuvraj was retained.

Chopra was reintroduced as Sehwag's partner in the 2004 Border-Gavaskar Trophy after Tendulkar was injured for the First Test in Bangalore. However, a heavy loss saw Chopra axed for the following match in Chennai upon Tendulkar's return, with Yuvraj elevated to opening the innings. Yuvraj also struggled, and Chopra was recalled for the Third Test in Nagpur. However, a double failure by Chopra, as Australia won a series in India for the first time in 35 years, saw him dropped for the last time, after his career average gradually decreased, however, from 46.25 to only 23. Chopra was replaced by Delhi teammate Gautam Gambhir, and was overtaken by Gambhir and Wasim Jaffer in the race to partner Sehwag in the Test side. Due to his low scoring rate, he was not considered for One Day Internationals.</FONT SIZE></P>

<P><FONT SIZE = "10">Shoaib akhtar is a pakistani fomal fast baller and he is the fastest baller in the history of cricket as we all pakistan is a team with so many quaility fast baller like shoaib , wasim , irfan kham,etc....Shoaib makes both cricket education means cricket training videos and commentry type videos.he has 2.54 million subscriber on youtube more than both aakash and raunac.He is a pakistani but loved in India also , here so many people like to watch his videos and he is a fantastic youtuber and a best fast baller we can say according to speed.</P>

<P>Shoaib Akhtar (About this soundpronunciation (help·info); born 13 August 1975) is a Pakistani former cricketer, commentator and YouTuber. He is recognised as the fastest bowler in the history of international cricket, having bowled a delivery at 161.3 km/h (100.23 mph), in a ODI against England – a pool match during the 2003 Cricket World Cup.Akhtar was nicknamed "Rawalpindi Express", in reference to his speed and hometown, and "Tiger". He was also the first bowler to be recorded bowling at 100 miles per hour, and did so twice in his career.</P>

<p>Akhtar made his Test debut in November 1997 as an opening fast bowler and played his first One Day International three months later. Akhtar has been involved in several controversies during his career, often accused of unsportsmanlike conduct, despite his commendations for significantly impacting games in Pakistan's favour. Akhtar was sent home during a Test match series in Australia in 2005 for alleged poor attitude. A year later, he was embroiled in a drug scandal after testing positive for the performance-enhancing substance nandrolone. However, the ban imposed on him was lifted on appeal.</p>

<p>In September 2007, he received a ban. On 1 April 2008, Akhtar was banned for five years for publicly criticising the Pakistan Cricket Board.In October 2008, the Lahore High Court in Pakistan suspended the five-year ban and Akhtar was selected in the 15-man squad for the Twenty20 Quadrangular Tournament in Canada.Pakistani judge Rana Bhagwandas once stated that Akhtar is a legend of Pakistan cricket.Akhtar retired from international cricket after the 2011 World Cup.</p>

    <p><font color = " red"><font size = "40"><u>Beyond cricket</u></font size></font color></p>

<p><font color = " green"><font size = "40"><u>Book</u></font size></font color></p>

<p>In September 2011, few months after his retirement from international cricket, he released his autobiography Controversially Yours, co-written with Indian social anthropologist and journalist Anshu Dogra.</p>

<p>It was met with positive reviews, observers noting the interest of having Shoaib’s comments, nearly always critical, on issues pertaining to the administration of cricket in Pakistan, the controversies surrounding ball tampering and his views on cricketers, from Pakistan as well outside.</p>

<p><font color = " red"><font size = "40">Drug scandal</font size></font color></p>

<p>On 16 October 2006 Akhtar was suspended by the Pakistan Cricket Board, along with Mohammed Asif after they tested positive for a performance-enhancing substance nandrolone. They were consequently pulled out from the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy. Former Pakistan Cricket Board chairman later stated that he had always suspected Akhtar of substance abuse due to his consistent "reservations" to drug tests. Former Pakistan captain Inzamam ul-Haq had also previously complained about Akhtar's drug abuse but was not reported to the Pakistan Cricket Board.Akhtar immediately declared his innocence and he declined knowingly taking any performance-enhancing drugs. In a statement issued to the press, he claimed that he could never cheat teammates or opponents.During a hearing with the Pakistan Cricket Board Anti-Doping Committee, he along with Asif maintained taking non-steroidal dietary supplements. He, however, failed to convince the committee of his innocence. In its report submitted to the Pakistan Cricket Board, the Anti-Doping Committee recommended a two-year ban.</p>

<p>On 1 November 2006 the Pakistan Cricket Board handed down a two-year suspension to Akhtar and a one-year suspension to Asif, banning them from professional cricket during the period.Shoaib had subsequently been added to Pakistan Olympic Association list of doping offenders.However, on 5 December 2006 represented by his lawyer Abid Hassan Minto, Akhtar was cleared on appeal.</p>

<p>On 5 December 2006 Akhtar and Asif were acquitted by the tribunal appointed to review their appeals. After a clear hearing from Akhtar's lawyer Abid Hassan Minto, the three-man committee, voted two to one in favour of the acquittal. Justice Fakhruddin Ebrahim, committee head, and Haseeb Ahsan, former Test cricketer, were in favour of the acquittal. The third member, Danish Zaheer, differed. "Exceptional circumstances" were cited including discrepancies between the instantaneous offence charges of doping that were laid and the quick delivery of a very harsh verdict. The complete drug testing procedure was concluded to have been technically flawed as it did not follow standard procedures. Other established facts by the committee included that the duo were not aware of the banned drug to be present in their supplements because the Pakistan Cricket Board itself had not informed them of the dangers of contaminated supplements.</p>

<p>Akhtar and Asif, however, did not play in the subsequent Test match series against the West Indies because the Pakistan Cricket Board had recommended that they play domestic games first to recover form and fitness.citation needed] On 1 March 2007 Akhtar and Asif were ruled out of the Pakistani squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup by team officials, minutes before the squad was to depart for the West Indies. The team management along with the Pakistan Cricket Board said their injuries were too severe to risk taking them to the Caribbean. Since neither of the two had been declared fit they did not undergo official doping tests.</p>

<p>World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA) challenged Pakistan's decision to lift bans on fast bowlers Akhtar and Asif by taking the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland.The ICC supported the WADA appeal adding that it was committed to a dope free game. On 2 July 2007, the Court of Arbitration for Sport dropped the case, ruling it had no jurisdiction to challenge the decision made by PCB.</p>

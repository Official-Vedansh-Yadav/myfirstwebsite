        <p class="p1">
            Born on 11 October 1993 in Surat, Gujarat into a financially challenged family, Hardik was never interested in studies. Hardik and his elder brother Krunal were enrolled into Kiran More’s Cricket Academy in Vadodara by their father Himanshu Pandya. Hardik was only five then. <br><br>

He dropped out of school in the ninth grade and started focussing on Cricket. The Pandya brothers used to travel by second-hand car to train while the family lived in a rented apartment. <br><br>


Hardik made a lot of progress in Junior Cricket and single-handedly won a lot of games for his club. However, his ‘attitude problems’ meant he was dropped from various state age-group teams. While others called it an attitude problem, Hardik terms it as “expressive”. <br><br>

Until 18, Pandya was a leg spinner. However, his coach Sanath Kumar convinced him to turn to fast bowling, and hence paving the way into the fast bowling all-rounder that provides the perfect balance to team India. <br><br>

            <p>
                Hardik’s blistering form in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy ensured he received his first India callup in the Australian tour. In his first match, he picked up 2 wickets in 3 overs and took one catch as India cruised to a 37-run victory. <br><br>

                In the following match, Pandya picked 1 wicket in 2 overs and took the important catch of Shaun Marsh as India won the series. While he did not get a chance to bat, Pandya’s contribution with the ball made sure he was retained for Sri Lanka’s tour of India. <br><br>
                
                Pandya’s first destructive innings with the bat for India came in the Asia Cup 2016. Pandya hit 31 of 18 balls to help India post a respectable score against Bangladesh. With the ball, he picked the wicket of a set Sabbir Rahman and secure the win. <br><br>
                
                
                
                In the second game against arch-rivals, Pakistan, Pandya bowled his best figures of 3 for 8. Hardik’s performance as a fast-bowling all-rounder caught everybody’s eyes as he chipped in with 5 wickets. <br><br>
                
                In a 2016 World Twenty20 match against Bangladesh, Pandya took two crucial wickets in the last three balls of the match’s final over as India beat Bangladesh by one run. <br><br>
                
                His career-best bowling figures of 4 for 38 was achieved in the 3rd and final Twenty20 International against England on July 8, 2018. With the bat, Pandya scored 33* in 14 balls. <br><br>
                
                
                
                He became the first Indian to pick 4 wickets and score over 30 runs in the same T20I match. Further, hitting the winning six of Chris Jordan in the final over gave him the finisher tag. More importantly, India had found their long-term replacement for MS Dhoni in the finisher role. <br><br>
